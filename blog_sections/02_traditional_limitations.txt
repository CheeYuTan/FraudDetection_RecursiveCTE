Why Traditional Fraud Detection Falls Short

Let's say your fraud analyst flags claim CLM00653351 — a $36,000 auto accident claim that looks suspicious. Great start. But here's what happens next with traditional approaches:

Manual Investigation (The Old Way):

1. Check the policyholder's other claims → Find 2 related claims
2. Manually look up those policyholders → Find 1 with same address
3. Check their claims → Find 3 more suspicious claims
4. Repeat the process... for hours or days
5. Eventually give up because it's too time-consuming

Result: You find 6-10 connected claims. The fraud ring has 47 members with $1.2M in fraudulent claims. You missed 85% of it.

Traditional SQL Queries (Still Limited):

-- This only finds claims from the SAME policyholder
SELECT * FROM claims WHERE policyholder_id = 'PH12345';

This misses the fraud ring entirely because they're smart enough to use multiple fake identities.

The Core Problem: Fraud networks require exploring relationships 2, 3, or 4 degrees away from the starting point. Traditional SQL can't traverse networks. You'd need to write separate queries for each "hop" — and fraud rings can be 5+ levels deep.
