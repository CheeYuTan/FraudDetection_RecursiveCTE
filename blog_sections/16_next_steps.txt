Next Steps: Automating with Agentic Systems

The stored procedures in this demo aren't just for manual investigation — they're designed to be called by AI agents for automated fraud detection workflows.

Imagine an agent that:
• Continuously monitors for suspicious claims
• Automatically calls `get_claim_relationships()` and `discover_fraud_network()`
• Analyzes network patterns and prioritizes cases
• Escalates high-risk fraud rings to analysts

The stored procedures are production-ready and agent-compatible — they can be registered as tools in Databricks AI agents for 24/7 automated fraud detection.
