Next Steps: Automating Fraud Detection with Agentic Systems

The stored procedures created in this demo aren't just for manual investigation — they're designed to be used by AI agents for automated fraud detection workflows.

Why Agentic Systems?

Traditional fraud detection requires analysts to:
• Manually identify suspicious claims
• Run queries to investigate
• Interpret results
• Decide on next actions

Agentic systems can automate this entire workflow by:
• Continuously monitoring for suspicious claims
• Automatically calling stored procedures to investigate
• Analyzing network patterns
• Prioritizing cases based on risk
• Generating investigation reports
• Escalating high-risk cases to human analysts

How It Works with Databricks

The stored procedures (`discover_fraud_network` and `get_claim_relationships`) can be called directly by AI agents:

1. Agent receives alert about suspicious claim
2. Agent calls `get_claim_relationships(claim_id)` to understand direct connections
3. Agent calls `discover_fraud_network(claim_id, max_depth=3)` to explore full network
4. Agent analyzes results:
   - Network size and fraud density
   - Total exposure amount
   - Key players (high-degree nodes)
5. Agent makes decision:
   - Low risk: Log and monitor
   - Medium risk: Flag for analyst review
   - High risk: Immediate escalation with full network report

Example Agent Workflow:

```
Agent: "I detected suspicious claim CLM00653351 ($36K). Investigating..."

Agent calls: get_claim_relationships('CLM00653351')
→ Finds 12 direct relationships
→ Identifies "Same Address" pattern

Agent calls: discover_fraud_network('CLM00653351', max_depth=3)
→ Discovers 454 claims in network
→ 45 fraudulent claims (9.9%)
→ Total exposure: $1.2M

Agent decision: "HIGH RISK - Fraud ring detected. 
                 Network size: 454 claims
                 Fraud density: 9.9%
                 Total exposure: $1,200,000
                 Escalating to Special Investigations Unit with full network graph."
```

Integration with Databricks AI Agents

Databricks supports agentic workflows through:
• **SQL Stored Procedures as Tools**: Your procedures can be registered as tools that agents can call
• **Lakehouse AI**: Built-in agent framework for automated data workflows
• **Unity Catalog Integration**: Secure access control for agent operations
• **Delta Sharing**: Share fraud detection capabilities across organizations

Benefits of Agentic Automation:

⚡ **24/7 Monitoring**: Continuous fraud detection without human intervention
📊 **Consistent Analysis**: Every suspicious claim gets the same thorough investigation
🎯 **Prioritization**: Agents automatically rank cases by risk and exposure
📈 **Scale**: Handle thousands of investigations simultaneously
🔄 **Learning**: Agents can learn from analyst feedback to improve decision-making

Getting Started with Agents:

1. Register your stored procedures as agent tools
2. Define agent prompts with fraud detection guidelines
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for agent decisions
4. Create feedback loops for continuous improvement
5. Integrate with your existing fraud investigation workflows

The stored procedures in this demo are production-ready and agent-compatible — they're designed to be called programmatically, return structured results, and integrate seamlessly with automated fraud detection systems.
