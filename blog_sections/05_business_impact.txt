Real-World Business Impact

Speed & Scale

Before (Traditional Analysis):
⏱️ 5-10 hours per suspected fraud case
👤 Requires senior fraud analyst
📊 Analyzes 2-3 cases per day
💰 Finds 20-30% of fraud network value

After (Recursive SQL):
⏱️ 8-15 seconds per case
🤖 Can be automated
📊 Analyzes 100+ cases per day
💰 Finds 95%+ of fraud network value

ROI Calculation

Let's do the math for a mid-sized insurance company:

Assumptions:
• 1,000 fraud investigations per year
• Average fraud ring value: $500,000
• Current detection rate: 25% of ring value ($125,000 recovered)
• With recursive analysis: 90% of ring value ($450,000 recovered)

Annual Impact:
• Additional fraud recovered: $325,000 × 1,000 cases = $325M
• Analyst time saved: 8 hours × 1,000 cases = 8,000 hours = 4 FTEs
• Cost savings: $400K+ in labor costs

Total annual value: $325M+ in fraud prevention and recovery
