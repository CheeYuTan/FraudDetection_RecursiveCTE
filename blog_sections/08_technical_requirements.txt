Technical Requirements (Simple)

What you need:
• Databricks workspace (free edition works for testing)
• Databricks Runtime 17.0+ (for recursive CTE support)
• Your existing claims and policyholder data

What you DON'T need:
• Separate graph databases (graph analysis runs in SQL on your data warehouse!)
• Neo4j, TigerGraph, or other specialized graph platforms
• Complex infrastructure changes or ETL to graph stores
• Expensive specialized tools
• Machine learning models (though they complement graph analysis beautifully)
