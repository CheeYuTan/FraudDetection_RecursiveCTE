Production Deployment: Built for Scale

This isn't a research project — it's production-ready:

Performance at Scale
✅ Sub-minute execution on 10M+ claim datasets
✅ Optimized for large datasets with smart row limits and filtering
✅ Databricks serverless compatible for cost efficiency
✅ Delta Lake optimization for fast joins and lookups

Enterprise Integration
🔄 Stored procedures for easy integration with existing systems
🤖 AI agent compatibility for automated fraud detection workflows
📊 BI tool compatible for executive dashboards
🔐 Databricks security model for compliance and audit

Real-World Optimizations

The demo includes production-grade optimizations:
• Filters for high-value claims (>$15K) to reduce noise
• Caps network expansion to prevent database overload
• Prioritizes fraudulent claims in results
• Uses indexed joins for maximum performance
