Getting Started

Ready to see this in action? The complete demo is open source and ready to run:

🔗 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/CheeYuTan/FraudDetection_RecursiveCTE

What's included:
1. ✅ Synthetic data generator (1K to 10M+ claims with realistic network patterns)
2. ✅ Graph network analysis with recursive SQL and stored procedures
3. ✅ Interactive network graph visualizations (the graphs shown above - PyVis)
4. ✅ Multi-entity heterogeneous network construction
5. ✅ Production-ready code with performance optimizations for large-scale graphs

Time to run your first fraud network analysis: 15 minutes

Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. Clone the repo in your Databricks workspace (Git integration)
2. Generate test data (Notebook 01 — configure volume with widgets)
3. Run fraud detection (Notebook 02 — see the interactive graphs)

That's it. You'll have a working fraud detection system analyzing networks in under an hour.
