Conclusion & Next Steps

Graph network analysis with recursive SQL transforms fraud detection from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, comprehensive investigation tool. By treating fraud as a network problem, we can discover entire fraud rings in seconds instead of days.

The stored procedures in this demo are production-ready and agent-compatible — they can be called by AI agents for 24/7 automated fraud detection. Imagine an agent that continuously monitors suspicious claims, automatically explores fraud networks, and escalates high-risk cases to analysts.

It's time to stop missing 85% of fraud rings and start discovering them in seconds — all with standard SQL in your existing data warehouse.
