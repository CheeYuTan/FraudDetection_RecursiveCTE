Conclusion

Graph network analysis with recursive SQL transforms fraud detection from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, comprehensive investigation tool. By treating fraud as a network problem rather than isolated incidents, we can discover entire fraud rings in seconds instead of days.

The combination of:
• Recursive CTEs for efficient network traversal
• Interactive graph visualizations for intuitive understanding
• Stored procedures for production-ready automation
• Agentic system compatibility for 24/7 monitoring

...makes this one of the most powerful fraud detection approaches available today — and it's all built on standard SQL in your existing data warehouse.

Whether you're fighting insurance fraud, financial crime, or any networked fraud pattern, recursive graph analysis gives you the tools to find the entire network, not just the individual fraudster.

The demo is ready to run. The code is production-ready. The impact is measurable.

It's time to stop missing 85% of fraud rings and start discovering them in seconds.
