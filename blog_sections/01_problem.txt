The Global Fraud Crisis

Insurance fraud is a massive global problem affecting every region. In the United States alone, insurance fraud costs approximately $308.6 billion annually — that's $933 per person per year, according to a 2022 study by the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. And this is just one country; the problem extends globally with billions more in losses across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other regions.

But here's what keeps fraud investigators up at night across all regions: they know they're only catching the obvious cases.

Traditional fraud detection systems can flag suspicious individual claims — a suspiciously high medical bill, an accident reported too soon after policy activation, or claims from known high-risk areas. But organized fraud? That's where things get complicated.

The real money is in the fraud rings — coordinated networks of fraudsters using multiple fake identities, shared addresses, and rotating service providers. These rings can generate millions of dollars in fraudulent claims before anyone notices the pattern.

The problem? Traditional SQL can't find them.
