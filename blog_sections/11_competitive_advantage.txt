The Competitive Advantage

Here's why this matters strategically:

Speed = Money Saved

Every day a fraud network operates costs thousands or millions. Cutting discovery time from days to seconds means:
• Earlier intervention = less fraud loss
• Faster law enforcement referrals = higher prosecution rates
• Immediate network shutdown = stopping ongoing fraud

Automation = Scale

When fraud detection runs in seconds, you can:
• Check every suspicious claim (not just high-priority)
• Continuous monitoring instead of periodic audits
• Real-time alerting for emerging fraud patterns
• Free up analysts for complex investigations

Completeness = Higher Recovery

Finding 95% of a fraud network instead of 25% means:
• Better recovery rates through civil action
• Stronger criminal cases with complete evidence
• Insurance subrogation from all involved parties
• Deterrent effect when fraudsters know you'll find them
