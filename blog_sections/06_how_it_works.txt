How It Works: The Fraud Investigation Workflow

Following the actual workflow from the demo notebooks, here's how fraud network analysis works in practice:

1. Data Preparation (Notebook 01)

First, you need your insurance data in Delta tables:
• Policyholders table (with addresses, phone numbers, demographics)
• Claims table (with claim amounts, dates, types, fraud flags)
• Adjusters table (service providers who process claims)

The demo includes a synthetic data generator that creates realistic fraud patterns, but in production, you'd use your existing transactional data.

2. Identify a Suspicious Claim

A fraud analyst flags a suspicious claim — typically identified by:
• Automated fraud detection models
• Manual reports from adjusters
• Pattern analysis (high value, multiple claims, unusual timing)

Example: Claim CLM00653351 — a $36,000 auto accident claim flagged as suspicious.

3. Understand Direct Relationships

Before exploring the full network, use the `get_claim_relationships()` stored procedure to see what makes this claim suspicious:

• Shows all claims directly connected to the suspicious claim
• Reveals the relationship type:
  - Same Address (policyholders sharing addresses)
  - Same Phone (policyholders sharing phone numbers)
  - Temporal Pattern (similar claims within 30 days)
  - Same Adjuster (claims processed by same adjuster within 90 days)

This gives you immediate context: "Why is this claim suspicious? What other claims are directly related?"

4. Discover the Full Fraud Network (The Recursive Magic)

Now use the `discover_fraud_network()` stored procedure with recursive CTEs:

• Starts from the suspicious claim (depth 0)
• Recursively traverses the network using breadth-first search
• Explores relationships 3-4 hops deep automatically
• Discovers the entire connected subgraph in seconds
• Returns all claims, policyholders, and relationships in the fraud ring

This is where traditional SQL fails and recursive SQL shines — it automatically follows connections through multiple levels without writing separate queries for each hop.

5. Visualize the Network Graph

The discovered network is visualized as an interactive graph:
• Claim Network Graph: Shows how fraudulent claims connect through shared policyholders
• Multi-Entity Network Graph: Shows claims, policyholders, and adjusters in one view
• Interactive features: Drag nodes, zoom, pan, hover for details
• Color coding: Red = fraud, Blue = legitimate, different shapes for entity types

6. Analyze Network Metrics

The system calculates key metrics:
• Total claims in network
• Fraudulent claims count and percentage
• Total exposure (sum of claim amounts)
• Network depth and breadth
• Key players (high-degree nodes)

This gives fraud analysts actionable intelligence: "This is a $1.2M fraud ring with 47 members — here's the complete network."
