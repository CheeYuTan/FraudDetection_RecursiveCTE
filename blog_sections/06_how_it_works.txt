How It Works (The Business View)

1. Network Graph Construction

The system continuously builds a graph from your transactional data:
• Nodes = Claims, Policyholders, Adjusters, Service Providers
• Edges = Relationships detected from shared attributes:
  - Policyholders sharing addresses or phone numbers (identity network)
  - Claims handled by the same service providers (service network)
  - Temporal patterns (timeline network)

2. Graph Traversal & Network Discovery

When a suspicious claim is flagged (by your existing fraud detection rules):
• Recursive SQL performs breadth-first graph traversal from the flagged node
• Automatically explores all edges and connected nodes
• Discovers the full fraud subgraph in seconds
• Maps network relationships 3-4 hops deep
• Identifies all involved entities (parties, service providers)

3. Interactive Network Graph Visualization

Fraud analysts see the complete fraud network as an interactive graph:
• Visual network topology (drag nodes, zoom, pan around the graph)
• Color-coded nodes (fraud vs. legitimate, different entity types)
• Network metrics (centrality, clustering, total exposure)
• Path visualization (how entities connect through the network)
• Actionable intelligence for law enforcement with visual proof

4. Network-Based Risk Scoring

The system automatically prioritizes investigations using graph metrics:
• Network size = Total nodes in the connected subgraph
• Fraud density = Percentage of fraudulent nodes in network
• Total exposure = Sum of claim amounts across the network
• Centrality scores = Key players in the fraud ring (high-degree nodes)
• Temporal activity = Network growth rate and recency
