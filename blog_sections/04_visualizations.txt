Seeing is Believing: Network Graph Visualization

Traditional fraud detection gives you a list of claim IDs. Graph network analysis gives you the complete picture — a visual network showing how everything connects:

[🎨 INSERT MAIN IMAGE: Claim Network Graph - Use claim_network_graph.png from your repo]

What you're looking at (network graph elements):
🔴 Red nodes = Confirmed fraudulent claims (fraud vertices in the graph)
🔵 Blue nodes = Legitimate claims caught in the network
• Node size = Claim amount (bigger nodes = more money at risk)
• Arrows (edges) = Connections discovered through graph traversal
• Network structure = Clear fraud ring clusters visible in the topology

This network graph shows 454 claims connected to the original suspicious claim — including 45 fraudulent claims (9.9%) totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. The visual clustering immediately reveals coordinated fraud patterns that would be invisible in a spreadsheet.

The Multi-Entity Fraud Network Graph

Going deeper, we can visualize the complete fraud ecosystem as a heterogeneous network graph — not just claims, but multiple entity types and their relationships:

[🌐 INSERT MAIN IMAGE: Multi-Entity Network Graph - Use multi_entity_network_graph.png from your repo]

Network Graph Legend (Multiple Node Types):
🔴🔵 Circles (Claim Nodes) = Claims (red = fraud, blue = legitimate)
🟠 Squares (Identity Nodes) = Policyholders
🟢 Triangles (Service Nodes) = Adjusters/Service Providers

Edge Types (Relationships):
• Solid gray lines = "Filed by" relationship (policyholder → claim)
• Dashed green lines = "Processed by" relationship (adjuster → claim)

What this network graph reveals:
• Hub nodes = Policyholders filing multiple high-value claims (central fraud operators)
• Suspicious clusters = Adjusters handling concentrations of fraudulent claims
• Bipartite patterns = Service providers involved across multiple fraud cases
• Network motifs = Structural patterns indicating the full "fraud factory" operation

This is multi-entity graph analysis — treating your business data as a heterogeneous network where different entity types connect through different relationship types. The visual topology immediately reveals fraud patterns that are invisible in traditional table-based analysis.
